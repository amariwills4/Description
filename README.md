# Amari — Software Developer

I am an emerging software developer with strong foundational skills in JavaScript, React, SQL, and full-stack web development. I bring a disciplined, detail-oriented approach to problem-solving and a strong commitment to writing clean, maintainable code.

My goal is to secure a software engineering internship or entry-level role where I can contribute to real-world projects, expand my technical skill set, and grow within a team of experienced developers.
