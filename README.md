# Hi, I'm Amari 👋  
Aspiring Software Developer | Lifelong Learner | Tech Enthusiast

I'm a dedicated developer currently building full-stack skills through hands-on projects, coding challenges, and bootcamp curriculum. I enjoy solving problems, creating clean user experiences, and continuously improving my craft.
